# etch_sketch
#
This is a project assigned from the Odin Project.

As the title suggests, it is a sketching website where you can paint using only the mouse cursor. Clicking is not required to paint. By default, the easel generates a 16x16 grid, but the user can set any 1:1 proportional grid.

v1
----------

1. Clear, Generate, Rainbow, Default shading implemented.
2. 80% of look of site.

ISSUES
----------

1. Safari does not render the easel field properly when a grid other than default is generated.
